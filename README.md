# React Interview Questions and Answers

### What is React ?
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook (now Meta) for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs).

#### Key Points:
1. **Library, not a framework**
React focuses specifically on building UI components. Unlike full-fledged frameworks (like Angular), it does not dictate things like routing or state management—those can be added using separate libraries (e.g., React Router, Redux).
2. **Component-Based**
Applications in React are built using reusable components, which manage their own state and logic.
3. **Declarative**
Instead of telling the DOM how to change (imperative), you describe what the UI should look like for a given state, and React updates it efficiently.
4. **Virtual DOM**
React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering and update only what’s necessary.

### Why React is popular compared to other frameworks like Angular, Vue, etc. ?
React is popular compared to other frameworks (like Angular, Vue, etc.) because of several key advantages that appeal to both developers and companies. Here's a breakdown of why:
1. **Component-Based Architecture**
- React encourages building UI using reusable, isolated components, making large applications easier to manage, test, and scale.
- Example: A Button, Modal, or FormInput component can be reused across the entire app.
2. **Virtual DOM = Better Performance**
- React uses a Virtual DOM, which compares old and new UI states and updates only what's necessary in the real DOM. This results in:
  - Faster rendering
  - Better performance for dynamic UIs
3. **Strong Community & Ecosystem**
- React has a massive global developer community and ecosystem:
  - Tons of open-source components and libraries
  - Lots of tutorials, courses, tools, and support
  - Backed by Meta (Facebook) and used by major companies like Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb, etc.
4. **JSX – Easy to Read and Write**
- React uses JSX, which combines HTML-like syntax with JavaScript, making it easier to visualize the UI structure within logic.
  ```
  const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
  ```
5. **Flexibility & Lightweight**
- React focuses only on the view layer, so developers can:
  - Choose their own libraries for routing (e.g., React Router)
  - Manage state using Redux, Zustand, or Context API
  - Use it with various backend stacks
- This flexibility makes React highly adaptable.
6. **React Native = Cross-Platform Development**
- React’s principles are extended to mobile development via React Native, allowing developers to build native apps for iOS and Android using the same React skills.
7. **Strong Tooling and Dev Experience**
- React DevTools for debugging
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant UI updates during development
- Hooks API (since React 16.8) makes managing state and side-effects easier in functional components
8. **Huge Job Market**
- Because of its popularity, there's high demand for React developers globally—making it a smart choice career-wise.
#### React vs Angular vs Vue
| Feature / Aspect |	React	| Angular |	Vue |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| Type |	Library (for UI)|	Full-fledged Framework	| Progressive Framework |
| Developed By	| Meta (Facebook) |	Google	| Evan You (ex-Google) |
| Language	|JavaScript + JSX|	TypeScript	|JavaScript + optional TypeScript|
|Learning Curve|	Moderate|	Steep (lots of concepts, RxJS, DI)|	Easy to Moderate|
|Data Binding	|One-way|	Two-way	|Two-way (can also use one-way)|
|DOM|	Virtual DOM|	Real DOM with change detection|	Virtual DOM|
|Performance|	Excellent (thanks to Virtual DOM)|	Very good|	Excellent|
|Component Model|	Functional + Class (now Hooks preferred)|	Class-based + Decorators|	Options API / Composition API|
|State Management|	React Context, Redux, Zustand, etc.|	Built-in (RxJS, Services)	|Vuex (or Pinia for modern apps)|
|Routing|	React Router	|Angular Router (built-in)|	Vue Router|
|Testing	|Jest, React Testing Library	|Jasmine, Karma (built-in)|	Jest, Mocha, Vue Test Utils|
|Mobile Development|	React Native|	NativeScript, Ionic|	Vue Native, Quasar, NativeScript|
|Size (bundle)|	Small to Medium|	Large (because of all built-ins)|	Small to Medium|
|Use Case |Fit	SPAs, enterprise apps, mobile apps|	Enterprise-scale apps, complex workflows	|Simple to medium complexity SPAs|
|Job Market| Very High	|High (especially in large enterprises|)	Growing steadily|
#### When to Choose What?
1. **React:**
